    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Chicken:</strong> Boneless, skinless chicken breasts (cut into cubes) are ideal for making classic chicken pot pie.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Vegetables:</strong> This chicken pot pie recipe calls for the usual suspects: peas, carrots, onions, and celery. 
            You could toss in some mushrooms or green peppers if you want to incorporate more veggies.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Butter and Flour:</strong> The chicken pot pie filling starts with a roux made with butter and all-purpose flour.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Seasoning:</strong> Achieve the perfect cosy flavour with salt, pepper, and celery seed. 
            Of course, you can add more seasoning to suit your taste.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Broth and Milk:</strong> Chicken broth and milk add depth of flavour and help create a smooth and decadent chicken pot pie filling consistency.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Pie Crusts:</strong> You'll need two unbaked pie crusts. If you opt for the homemade route, you can't go wrong with our

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients and preheat the oven to 220 degrees celsius</li>
        <li>Combine chicken, carrots, peas, and celery in a saucepan; add water to cover and bring to a boil. Boil for 15 minutes, then remove from the heat and drain.</li>
        <li>While the chicken is cooking, melt butter in another saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and cook until soft and translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in flour, salt, pepper, and celery seed</li>
        <li>Slowly stir in chicken broth and milk.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until thick, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
        <li>Place chicken and vegetables in the bottom pie crust. Pour hot liquid mixture over top.</li>
        <li>Cover with top crust, seal the edges, and cut away any excess dough. Make several small slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until pastry is golden brown and filling is bubbly, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately and enjoy!</li>
