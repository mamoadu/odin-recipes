    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Chicken:</strong> Boneless, skinless chicken breasts (cut into cubes) are ideal for making classic chicken pot pie.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Vegetables:</strong> This chicken pot pie recipe calls for the usual suspects: peas, carrots, onions, and celery. 
            You could toss in some mushrooms or green peppers if you want to incorporate more veggies.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Butter and Flour:</strong> The chicken pot pie filling starts with a roux made with butter and all-purpose flour.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Seasoning:</strong> Achieve the perfect cosy flavour with salt, pepper, and celery seed. 
            Of course, you can add more seasoning to suit your taste.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Broth and Milk:</strong> Chicken broth and milk add depth of flavour and help create a smooth and decadent chicken pot pie filling consistency.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Pie Crusts:</strong> You'll need two unbaked pie crusts. If you opt for the homemade route, you can't go wrong with our 
            <a href="">Butter Flaky Pie Crust recipe</a> â€” but store-bought is perfectly fine.

    </ul>
