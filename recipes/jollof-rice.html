    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This bold-flavoured jollof rice, my version of the dish served all over West Africa, will go well with any spicy chicken, meat, or fish.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Blended Sauce:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 red bell peppers, seeded and cut into chunks</li>
                    <li>2 tomatoes, cut into chunks</li>
                    <li>1 habanero pepper, seeded</li>
                    <li>1 clove garlic</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup chicken stock</li>
                </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Rice:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>
                    <li>1 small yellow onion, diced</li>
                    <li>3 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
                    <li>1 1/2 cups parboiled rice, such as BEN'S ORIGINALâ„¢</li>
                    <li>3 cups chicken stock, or more as needed</li>
                    <li>2 teaspoons curry powder</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon ground white pepper</li>
                    <li>2 bay leaves</li>
                    <li>salt to taste</li>
                    <li>1 cup mixed vegetables</li>
                    <li>3 1/2 tablespoons salted butter</li>
                </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Place bell peppers, tomatoes, habanero pepper, garlic, and 1/4 cup stock in a blender or food processor; blend until smooth. The consistency will be similar to a thick marinara sauce. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large pot, heat oil over medium heat. Add diced onion and fry until onion is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add tomato paste and cook for about 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Add rice and cook for about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in blended sauce mix, 3 cups stock, curry powder, thyme, white pepper, and bay leaves; season to taste with salt. Stir well and bring the pot to a boil.</li>
        <li>Turn the heat down to low, cover the pot and cook until rice has absorbed all the liquid, adding more stock if needed to soften the rice, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in mixed vegetables and butter. Cover, and let cook for 5 minutes. Turn heat off, allow the steam to finish cooking vegetables, about 5 minutes more. Stir before serving.</li>
    </ol>
